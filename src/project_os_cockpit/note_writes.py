"""Guarded note write-back for the review desk (FEAT-0041).

Two mutations, both narrow by construction:

* :func:`stamp_review` — writes the three independent-review fields
  (``reviewed_by`` / ``review_date`` / ``review_verdict``), optionally
  with a guarded status transition.
* :func:`stamp_test_run` — writes a manual test's outcome (``status`` +
  ``last_run``) and appends a run log under ``## Runs``.

Everything else about a note is off-limits. That is a deliberate design
constraint rather than an implementation shortcut: PHASE-007 drew the
line at "the cockpit is a viewer", and ADR-0007 crosses it only far
enough to record a decision a human made in the UI. The allow-list below
is what keeps that crossing honest, and the tests assert it.

Hardening (TASK-0207 DoD, folded in from the preflight risk scan rather
than filed as a separate RISK):

* **Field allow-list** — a payload naming any other frontmatter key is
  rejected outright; the writer never merges caller-supplied dicts.
* **Guarded transitions** — a status must exist in ``statuses.py`` and be
  one of the transitions this module permits; anything else is a 4xx with
  nothing written.
* **Path canonicalisation** — targets resolve through the index and must
  land inside ``docs_root`` (the TASK-0174 case-canonicalisation
  precedent), so no traversal reaches the filesystem.
* **Concurrency** — an ``mtime`` precondition from the reader means a
  note edited underneath the reviewer fails loudly instead of silently
  clobbering the newer text.
* **Snapshot untouched** — ADR-0009: notes are the authored source, and
  ``sync-snapshot.py`` propagates at pre-commit. This module never edits
  SNAPSHOT.yaml.

The endpoints that call this refuse non-loopback callers — a per-request
peer-address check on the shared 0.0.0.0 socket, not a separate bind. The
distinction matters: the render server binds 0.0.0.0 so a tablet can read
the notes, and the guard is what keeps mutation off that surface (the
RISK-0001 threat model; the terminal endpoint gets a real second bind
because it can afford one).
