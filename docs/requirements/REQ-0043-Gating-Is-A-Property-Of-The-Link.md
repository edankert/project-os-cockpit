acceptance:
  - "[ ] One rule gates every item type: an item may not reach a terminal status while a test covering it is unsettled. A task, an issue, a requirement, a feature and a release are gated by the same sentence."
  - "[ ] No gate anywhere reads `level:`, `tier:`, `kind:` or the presence of a `command:` to decide WHETHER something gates. Execution mode may decide what `settled` means; it may not decide what is gated."
  - "[ ] The derived gate names the same blocking SET as the tier gate, per repo, before the tier rule is retired. Baseline: 0 / 56 / 60."
  - "[ ] No acceptance row reaches a badge. Aggregation and ADR-0028's in-flight rule are what hold that, and both are explicit rather than incidental."

# Gating is a property of the link

Edwin: *"manual tests are not different to acceptance tests or other tests, they should be able to gate at any granularity."*

The rule this requirement forbids is any sentence of the form *"a test of kind X gates Y"*. What a test gates is what it says it covers — and that link already exists, in one direction, on one field.

**The measured hole is the reason for the third criterion**: 83 of 669 acceptance tests cover nothing today. Until they do, the derived gate is quieter than the rule it replaces, and quieter is the one direction a gate must never move without somebody deciding it.
