# The emitter

## Definition of Done

- [ ] A green CI run appends one `method: automated` entry per covered check, with `by:` naming the test and `date:` the run.
- [ ] A failing test emits `mark: fail` with the failure as the reason, or emits nothing — decided explicitly, not defaulted.
- [ ] The platform comes from the run's target, and the entry lands in that platform's working ledger.
- [ ] **Deleting a covering test puts its check back on the run list within one CI cycle — proved.**

## Notes

Criterion 4 is the whole point of Stage 2 and the one thing a standing field could not do.

**The limit, and it must not be papered over:** [[ISS-0209]] — the acceptance gate runs in **no repo that holds a check**. Until that is resolved this emitter runs here and nowhere the data lives, so criterion 4 is proved in `project-os-cockpit` only. State that; do not report the fleet as covered.

The failing-test decision matters more than it looks. Emitting `fail` puts a machine-driven population into the release gate — the behaviour change [[ADR-0031]] recorded as a risk rather than discovering later. Same call, same place to record it.

## Re-homed 2026-08-20 — the parent moved and this did not

[[FEAT-0138]] was re-homed from [[PHASE-999]] into [[PHASE-037]] on 2026-08-20 (Edwin). **Its tasks stayed behind**, so a task pointed at a parking-lot phase while the feature it delivers pointed at an active one.

That is not cosmetic: `PHASE-CHILDREN` gates a phase on **notes naming it in `phase:`**, so for as long as this task named `PHASE-999` it was invisible to the gate on the phase that actually owns its work — and `PHASE-999` is never closed, so it was invisible to every gate. A child in a parking lot cannot hold anything open.

The phase's own widening note records the same class of miss one level up: *"FEAT-0138 also pointed at PHASE-999 without ever being listed in it, which is why nothing flagged it."*

**The consequence is deliberate.** [[PHASE-037]] now cannot close while this task is unresolved. That is the honest reading of Edwin's re-homing: if the feature belongs to this phase, so does the work that delivers it.
